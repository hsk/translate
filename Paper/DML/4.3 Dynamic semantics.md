- 4.3 Dynamic semantics

	We now need to extend the definition of evaluation contexts (Definition 2.4) as follows.

	- Definition 4.8 (Evaluation Contexts)

			evaluation contexts E ::= ... | ⊃+(E) | ⊃−(E) | Π+(E) | Π−(E) |
			                          ∧(E) | let ∧(x) = E in e end |
			                          Σ(E) | let Σ(x) = E in e end

		We are also in need of extending the definition of redexes and their reducts (Defi-nition 2.5).

	- Definition 4.9

		In addition to the forms of redexes in Definition 2.5, we have the following new forms of redexes:

		- ⊃−(⊃+(v)) is a redex, and its reduct is v.
		- Π−(Π+(v)) is a redex, and its reduct is v.
		- let ∧(x) = ∧(v) in e end is a redex, and its reduct is e[x |→ v].
		- let Σ(x) = Σ(v) in e end is a redex, and its reduct is e[x |→ v].

		Note that Definition 2.7, where V-form, R-form, M-form, U-form and E-form are defined, can be readily carried over from λpat into λΠ,Σ pat .

	The following lemma captures the meaning of the typing judgments for patterns; such judgments can be derived according to the rules in Figure 15.

	- Lemma 4.10

		Assume that ∅; ∅; ∅ |- v : τ is derivable.
		If p ↓ τ ⇒ (φ; P~ ; Γ) and match(v, p) ⇒ θ are also derivable, then there exists Θ satisfying ∅ |- Θ : φ such that both ∅; ∅ |= P~ [Θ] and (∅; ∅; ∅) |- θ : Γ[Θ] hold.

		- Proof

			(Sketch) By structural induction on the derivation of p ↓ τ ⇒ (φ; P~ ; Γ). □
