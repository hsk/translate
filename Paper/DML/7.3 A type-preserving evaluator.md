- 7.3 A type-preserving evaluator
	
	We now implement an evaluator for an object language based on the simply typed λ-calculus, capturing in the type system of DML that the evaluator is type-preserving at the object level.

	Apart form using integer expressions as type indexes in the previous examples, we employ algebraic terms as type indexes in this example.

	We use the following syntax to define a sort ty for representing simple types in the object language:
	
		datasort ty = Bool | Int | Arrow of (ty, ty)
	
	where we assume that Bool and Int represent two simple base types ˆbool and int ˆ , respectively, and Arrow represents (the overloaded) constructor → for forming simple
	function types. For instance, we use the term Arrow(Int, Arrow(Int,Bool)) to represent the simple type int ˆ → (intˆ → ˆbool) in the object language, where ˆbool and int ˆ are two simple base types and (the overloaded) → is a simple type constructor.

	We use a form of higher-order abstract syntax (h.o.a.s) (Church, 1940; Pfenning & Elliott, 1988; Pfenning, n.d.) to represent expressions in the object language.

	In Figure 31, we declare a type constructor EXP, which takes a type

		datatype EXP (ty) =
		EXPint (Int) of int
		| EXPbool (Bool) of bool
		| EXPadd (Int) of EXP (Int) * EXP (Int)
		| EXPsub (Int) of EXP (Int) * EXP(Int)
		| EXPmul(Int) of EXP (Int) * EXP (Int)
		| EXPdiv(Int) of EXP (Int) * EXP (Int)
		| EXPzero (Bool) of EXP (Int)
		| {a: ty} EXPif (a) of EXP (Bool) * EXP (a) * EXP (a)
		| {a1: ty, a2: ty} EXPlam (Arrow (a1, a2)) of (EXP (a1) -> EXP (a2))
		| {a1: ty, a2: ty} EXPapp (a2) of (EXP (Arrow (a1, a2)), EXP (a1))
		| {a1: ty, a2: ty} EXPlet (a2) of (EXP (a1), (EXP(a1) -> EXP(a2)))
		| {a: ty} EXPfix (a) of (EXP (a) -> EXP (a))
	
	Fig. 31. A datatype for higher-order abstract syntax

	index term I of sort ty to form a type EXP(I) for the values that represent closed expressions in the object language that can be assigned the type represented by I.

	For example, the function λx : int ˆ .x + x in the object language is represented as EXPlam(lam x. EXPadd(x, x)), which can be given the type EXP(Arrow(Int,Int)).

	The usual factorial function can be represented as follows (in the concrete syntax of DML),

		EXPfix (lam f =>
		EXPlam (lam x =>
		EXPif (EXPzero (x),
		EXPint(1),
		EXPmul (x, EXPapp (f, EXPsub (x, EXPint(1)))))))

	which can also be given the type EXP(Arrow(Int,Int)).

	We often refer to such a representation as a form of typeful representation since the type of an expression in the object language is now reflected in the type of the representation of the expression.

	We now implement a function evaluate in Figure 32.

	The function is an evaluator for the object language, taking (the representation of) an object expression and returning (the representation of) the value of the object expression. Notice that the function is assigned the type Πa:ty. EXP(a) → EXP(a), indicating that the function is type-preserving at the object level.

	Also, we point out that (extended) type-checking in DML guarantees that no pattern matching failure can occur in this example.
	
	Clearly, a natural question is whether we can also implement a type-preserving evaluator for an object language based on the second-order polymorphic λ-calculus or system F (Girard, 1972).

	In order to do so, we need to go beyond algebraic terms, employing λ-terms to encode polymorphic types in the object language.

	First we extend the definition of the sort ty as follows so that universally quantified types can also be represented:

		datasort ty = ... | All of (ty -> ty)
		fun evaluate (v as EXPint _) = v
		| evaluate (v as EXPbool _) = v
		| evaluate (EXPadd (e1, e2)) = let // no pattern matching failure
		val EXPint (i1) = evaluate e1 and EXPint (i2) = evaluate e2
		in EXPint (i1+i2) end
		(* the cases for EXPsub, EXPmul, EXPdiv are omitted *)
		| evaluate (EXPzero e) = let // no pattern matching failure
		val EXPint (n) = evaluate e
		in EXPbool (n=0) end
		| evaluate (EXPif (e0, e1, e2)) = let // no pattern matching failure
		val EXPbool (b) = evaluate e0
		in if b then evaluate e1 else evaluate e2 end
		| evaluate (EXPapp (e1, e2)) = let // no pattern matching failure
		val EXPlam (f) = evaluate e1
		in evaluate (f (evaluate e2)) end
		(* the case for EXPlet is omitted *)
		| evaluate (v as EXPlam _) = v
		| evaluate (e as EXPfix f) = evaluate (f e)
		withtype {a: ty} EXP (a) -> EXP (a)

	Fig. 32. An implementation of a type-preserving evaluation function in DML

	Given a term f of sort ty → ty, All(f) represents the type ∀α. τ if for each type τ0, f(t) represents the type τ [α 7→ τ0] as long as t represents the type τ0.

	For instance, All(λa.Arrow(a, Arrow(a,Int))) represents the type ∀α.α → α → int; the term All(λa.(All(λb.Arrow(a, Arrow(b, a))))) represents the type ∀α.∀β.α → β → α.

	With this strategy, we have no difficulty in implementing a type-preserving evaluator for an object language based on the second-order polymorphic language calculus.

	We have actually already done this in the programming language ATS (Xi, 2005).

	Note that the type indexes involved in this example are drawn from Lλ.

	It is also possible to implement a type-preserving evaluator through the use of first-order abstract syntax (f.o.a.s), and further details on this subject can be found in (Chen & Xi, 2003; Chen et al., 2005), where some interesting typeful program transformations (e.g., a call-by-value continuation-passing style (CPS) transformation (Meyer & Wand, 1985; Griffin, 1990)) are studied.

	In (Xi et al., 2003), a typeful implementation of simply typed λ-calculus based on guarded recursive (g.r.) datatypes is presented.

	There, a g.r. datatype constructor HOAS (of the kind type → type) is declared such that for each simply typed λ-expression of some simple type T, its representation can be assigned the type (T)HOAS, where T is the representation of T. More precisely, T can be defined as follows:

		b = b T1 → T2 = T1 → T2

	where each simple base type b is represented by a type b (in the implementation language).

	For instance, the type for the representation of the simply typed expression λx : int ˆ .x is (int ˆ → int ˆ )HOAS, where int ˆ is a simple base type.

	With this representation for simply typed λ-calculus, an evaluation function of the type ∀α.(α)HOAS → α can be implemented.

	A particular advantage of this implementation is that we can use native tagless values in the implementation language to directly represent values of object expressions.

	This can be of great use in a setting (e.g., meta-programming) where the object language needs to interact with the implementation language (Chen & Xi, 2005b). Given that DML is a conservative extension of ML, this is clearly something that cannot be achieved in DML.

	The very reason for this is that DML does not allow type equalities like τ1 .= τ2 (meaning both τ1 ≤ τ2 and τ2 ≤ τ1) to appear in index contexts φ.

	In ATS, this restriction is lifted, resulting in a much more expressive type system but also a (semantically) much more complicated constraint relation (on types and type indexes) (Xi, 2004).
