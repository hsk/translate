- 5.5 Implementing elaboration

	A typed programming language ATS is currently under development (Xi, 2005), and its type system supports the form of dependent types in λΠ,Σ pat .

	The elaboration process in ATS is implemented in a manner that follows the presented elaboration rules closely, providing concrete evidence in support of the practicality of these rules.

	We now mention some strategies adopted in this implementation to address nondeterminism in elaboration.

	- The dynamic subtype rules in Figure 21 are applied according to the order in which they are listed.

		In other words, if two or more dynamic subtype rules are applicable, then the one listed first is chosen. It is important to always choose (dy-sub-Π-r) and (dy-sub-Σ-l) over (dy-sub-Π-l) and (dy-sub-Σ-r), respectively.

	For instance, this is necessary when we prove ∅; ∅ ` τ ≤ τ for τ = Πa:int. int(a) → int(a) and also for τ = Σa:int. int(a).

	- The following ”left” rules:
		— (elab-up-Σ-left) and (elab-dn-Σ-left)
		— (elab-up-prod-left) and (elab-dn-prod-left)
		are chosen whenever they are applicable.

	- The rule (elab-up-app-2) is in general chosen over the rule (elab-up-app-1).

		However, we also provide some special syntax to allow the programmer to indicate that the rule (elab-up-app-1) is preferred in a particular case.

		For instance, the special syntax for doing this in ATS is {...}: we write e1 {...}(e2) to indicate that a type of the form τ1 → τ2 needs to be synthesized out of e1 and then e2 is to be checked against τ1.

		This kind of elaboration is mostly used in a case where the expression e1 is a higher-order function, saving the need for explicitly annotating the expression e2.

	- We choose the rule (elab-dn-up), which turns analysis into synthesis, only when no other analysis elaboration rules are applicable.

		The general principle we follow is to prefer analysis over synthesis as the former often makes better use of type annotations and yields more accurate error message report.

	While the description of elaboration in terms of the rules in Figure 21, Figure 22 and Figure 23 is intuitively appealing, there is still a substantial gap between the description and its implementation.

	For instance, the elaboration rules are further refined in (Xi, 1998) to generate constraints when applied, and there are also various issues of reporting error messages as informative as possible.

	As these issues are mostly concerned with an actual implementation of elaboration, they are of relatively little theoretical significance and thus we plan to address them elsewhere in different contexts.
