- 5.4 The soundness of elaboration

	We now prove the soundness of elaboration, that is, elaboration cannot alter the dynamic semantics of a program.

	To make the statement more precise, we define in Figure 24 an erasure function | · | from DML0 to λpat. The following lemma is the key to establishing the soundness of elaboration.
	
	- Lemma 5.2
	
		Given φ, P~, Γ, e, τ, τ0 and e, we have the following:
		
		1. If φ; P~ ` E : τ ≤ τ0 is derivable, then φ; P~ |= E : τ ≤d tp τ0 holds.
		2. If φ; P~; Γ ` e ↑ τ ⇒ e is derivable, then φ; P~ ; Γ ` e : τ is derivable in λ Π,Σ pat , and |e| ,→∗ g |e| holds.
		3. If φ; P~; Γ ` e ↓ τ ⇒ e is derivable, then φ; P~ ; Γ ` e : τ is derivable in λ Π,Σ pat ,and |e| ,→∗ g |e| holds.

	- Proof

		(Sketch) (1), (2) and (3) are proven simultaneously by structural induction on the derivations of φ; P~ ` E : τ ≤ τ0, φ; P~; Γ ` e ↑ τ ⇒ e and φ; P~; Γ ` e ↓ τ ⇒ e. □

	The soundness of elaboration is justified by the following theorem:

	- Theorem 5.3

		Assume that ∅; ∅; ∅ ` e ↑ τ ⇒ e is derivable.

		Then ∅; ∅; ∅ ` e : τ is derivable and |e| ≤dyn |e|.

	- Proof

		This follows from Lemma 5.2 and Lemma 2.14 immediately. □
