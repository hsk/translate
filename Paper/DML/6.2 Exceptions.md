- 6.2 Exceptions

	We further extend λΠ,Σ pat with exceptions.

	First, we introduce the following additional syntax, where exn is the type for values representing exceptions.

		types τ ::= . . . | exn
		expressions e ::= . . . | raise(e) | try e with ms
		answers ans ::= v | raise(v)

	An answer of the form raise(v) is called a raised exception, where v is the exception being raised.

	We also introduce in Figure 27 some new forms of ev-redexes and their reducts, which are needed for propagating a raised exception to the top level.

	In addition, we introduce a new form of evaluation context to allow a raised exception to be captured (potentially):

		evaluation contexts E ::= . . . | try E with ms

	The following typing rules are needed for handling the newly added language constructs:

		φ; P~; Γ ` e : exn
		φ; P~; Γ ` raise(e) : σ
		(ty-raise)
		φ; P~ ; Γ ` e : τ φ; P~; Γ ` ms : exn → τ
		φ; P~ ; Γ ` try e with ms : τ
		(ty-try)

	Again, the type soundness of this extension rests upon the following two theorems:

	- Theorem 6.3 (Subject Reduction)

		Assume D :: ∅; ∅; ∅ ` e1 : σ e1 ,→ev e2. Then ∅; ∅; ∅ ` e2 : σ is also derivable.

	- Theorem 6.4 (Progress)

		Assume that ∅; ∅; ∅ ` e1 : σ is derivable.

		Then there are the following possibilities:

		- e1 is a value, or
		- e1 is a raised exception, or
		- e1 is in M-form, or
		- e1 is in U-form, or
		- e1 ,→ev e2 holds for some expression e2.

		We omit the proofs for these two theorems, which are essentially the same as the ones for Theorem 4.11 and Theorem 4.12.
		
		----

		Assume the existence of two exception constants Match and Undefined that are assigned the c-type () ⇒ exn.

		We can then introduce the following evaluation rules for handling expressions in M-form or U-form:
		case v of ms ,→ev raise(Match) if v matches none of the patterns in ms.
		cf(v) ,→ev raise(Undefined) if cf(v) is undefined.

		Then the progress theorem can be stated as follows:

	- Theorem 6.5 (Progress)

		Assume that ∅; ∅; ∅ ` e1 : σ is derivable. Then there are the following possibilities:

		- e1 is a value, or
		- e1 is a raised exception, or
		- e1 ,→ev e2 holds for some expression e2.

		So we can now claim that the evaluation of a well-typed program either terminates with an answer, that is, a value or a raised exception, or goes on forever.
