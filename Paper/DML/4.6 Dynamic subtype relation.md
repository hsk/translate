- 4.6 Dynamic subtype relation
	
	The dynamic subtype relation defined below is much stronger than the static subtype relation ≤s tp and it plays a key role in Section 5, where an elaboration process is presented to facilitate program construction in λΠ,Σ pat .

	- Definition 4.15 (Dynamic Subtype Relation)

		We write φ; P~ |= E : τ ≤d tp τ0 to mean that for any expression e and context Γ, if φ; P~ ; Γ |- e : τ is derivable then both φ; P~ ; Γ |- E[e] : τ0 is derivable and |e| ≤dyn |E[e]| holds.

		We may write φ; P~ |= τ ≤d tp τ0 if, for some E, φ; P~ |= E : τ ≤d tp τ0 holds, where E can be thought of as a witness to τ ≤d tp τ0.

		As is desired, the dynamic subtype relation ≤d tp is both reflexive and transitive.

	- Proposition 4.16 (Reflexitivity and Transitivity of ≤d tp)

		1. φ; P~ |= [] : τ ≤d tp τ holds for each τ such that φ |- τ [type] is derivable.
		2. φ; P~ |= E2[E1] : τ1 ≤d tp τ3 holds if φ; P~ |= E1 : τ1 ≤d tp τ2 and φ; P~ |= E2 : τ2 ≤dtp τ3 do, where E2[E1] is the evaluation context formed by replacing the hole [] in E2 with E1.

		- Proof

			(Sketch) The proposition follows from the fact that the relation ≤dyn is both re-flexive and transitive. □
