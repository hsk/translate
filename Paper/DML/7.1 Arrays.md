- 7.1 Arrays

	Arrays are a widely used data structure in practice.

	We use array as a built-in type constructor that takes a type τ and a natural number n to form the type (τ )array(n) for arrays of size n in which each element has the type τ.

	We also have the built-in functions sub, update and make, which are given the following c-types:

		sub : ∀α.Πn:nat.Πi:{a : nat | a < n}. (α)array(n) ∗ int(i) ⇒ α
		update : ∀α.Πn:nat.Πi:{a : nat | a < n}. (α)array(n) ∗ int(i) ∗ α ⇒ 1
		make : ∀α.Πn:nat. int(n) ∗ α ⇒ (α)array(n)

	There is no built-in function for computing the size of an array.

	Notice that the c-type of sub indicates that the function can be applied to an array and an index only if the value of the index is a natural number less than the size of the array.

	In other words, the quantification Πn : nat.Πi : {a : nat | a < n} acts like a precondition for the function sub.

	The c-type of update imposes a similar requirement.

	We may, however, encounter a situation where the programmer knows or believes for some reason that the value of the index is within the bounds of the array, but this property is difficult or even impossible to be captured in the type system of DML.

	In such a situation, the programmer may need to use run-time array bound checks to overcome the difficulty. We now present some type-theoretical justification for run-time array bound checking in DML.

	In Figure 28, we declare a type constructor Array for forming types for arrays with size information.

	The only value constructor Array associated with the type constructor Array is assigned the following c-type:

		∀α.Πn:nat. int(n) ∗ (α)array(n) ⇒ (α)Array(n)

	The defined functions arraySub, arrayUpdate and makeArray correspond to the 3 Each valid index of an array is a natural number less than the size of the array datatype ’a Array with nat = {n:nat} Array(n) of int(n) * ’a array(n) exception Subscript

		fun(’a) arraySub (Array(n, a), i) =
		if (i < 0) then raise Subscript
		else if (i >= n) then raise Subscript
		else sub (a, i)
		withtype {n:nat,i:int} ’a Array(n) * int(i) -> ’a
		fun(’a) arrayUpdate (Array(n, a), i, x) =
		if (i < 0) then raise Subscript
		else if (i >= n) then raise Subscript
		else update (a, i, x)
		withtype {n:nat,i:int} ’a Array(n) * int(i) * ’a -> unit
		fun(’a) makeArray (n, x) = Array (n, make (n, x))
		withtype {n:nat} int(n) * ’a -> ’a Array(n)
		fun(’a) arrayLength (Array(n, _)) = n
		withtype {n:nat} ’a Array(n) -> int(n)

	functions sub, update and make, respectively.

	Note that run-time array bound checks are inserted in the implementation of arraySub and arrayUpdate.

	For an array carrying size information, the function arrayLength simply extracts out the information.

	Additional examples can be found in (Xi & Pfenning, 1998) that makes use of dependent types in eliminating run-time array bound checks.

	Clearly, the programmer now has the option to decide which subscripting (updating) function should be used: sub or arraySub (update or arrayUpdate)?

	When compared to the former, the latter is certainly less efficient and may incur a runtime exception.

	However, in order to use the former, the programmer often needs to capture more program invariants by supplying type annotations.

	This point is shown clearly when we compare the two (essentially identical) implementations of the standard binary search on integer arrays in Figure 29.

	In the first implementation, we use the array subscripting function arraySub, which incurs run-time array bound checks.

	In the second implementation, we instead use sub, which incurs no run-time array bound checks.

	Clearly, the second implementation is superior to the first one when either safety or efficiency is of the concern.

	However, the programmer needs to provide a more informative type for the inner function loop in order to eliminate the array bound checks.

	In this case, the provided type captures the invariant that i ≤ j +1 ≤ n holds whenever loop is called, where i and j are integer values of l and u, respectively, and n is the size of the array being searched.
